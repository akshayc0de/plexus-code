# Project Title

Plexus Front-End Code Challenge

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Node 
```

### Installing

To get the project up and running 
```
Download or Clone the repo
```
Please navigate to the folder within CLI(Terminal/CMD) and run the following command, please ensure that Node is installed on your machine 
```
> npm install
```
After the packages have installed
```
> yarn start || npm start
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Unfortunately due to time constraints and the complexity involved in creating this in ReactJS I did not get time to install cypress and test the front end, but I have made sure that the functionality works 

### What did not work
Due to my newness to React, I was not able to fully get the autocomplete to work, although with more time and exposure I am fully confident that I will become really good with this library and prove my skills in large projects
