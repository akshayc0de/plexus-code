# Plexus Front-End Code Challenge

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Node 
```

### Installing

To get the project up and running 
```
Download or Clone the repo
```
Please navigate to the folder within CLI(Terminal/CMD) and run the following command, please ensure that Node is installed on your machine 
```
> npm install
```
After the packages have installed
```
> yarn start || npm start
```

## The challenge
Develop a multi step form which conditionally renders, validates, autocompletes through a GET request on input event and posts the data to an endpoint. Use React to develop the solution and ensure that everything works.

## The Solution
Using create-react-app boilerplate a solution was built using components separating the front-end into multiple sections. State management was used extensively to add functionality to the project. 

## Running the tests

Unfortunately due to time constraints and the complexity involved in creating this in ReactJS I did not get time to install cypress and test the front end, but I have made sure that the functionality works 

## What did not work

I have been coding in React for less than 7 months, due to not being exposed to a lot of the functionality that I would rather use vanilla JS for and as a result I was not able to fully get the autocomplete to work to expectation, although with more time and exposure I am fully confident that I will become really good with this library and prove my skills in large projects
